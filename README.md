# FlavorQuest üç≤

A recipe web app built with **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS**.  
It lets users explore recipes, view details, and manage a basic profile with login/logout (no backend, just frontend simulation).


## Features
- Browse recipes (includes chicken dishes and sample Kenyan meals).
- Search recipes from the home page.
- View recipe details with ingredients and instructions.
- Profile section with a fake login/logout system.
- Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern and colorful UI.


## Challenges
- Adding Kenyan/African dishes while learning React.
- Handling navigation between Home, About, Profile, and Recipe pages.
- Managing login state without a backend (solved with simple React state).


## Next Steps
- Add more Kenyan and homemade recipes.
- Improve search and filtering.
- Add ability to save favorite recipes.
- Work towards real authentication in the future.
