# FlavorQuest üç≤

A recipe web app built with React, Vite and CSS.  
It lets users explore recipes, view details, and manage a basic profile with login/logout (no backend, just frontend simulation).

## Features
- Browse recipes from TheMealDB API.
- Search recipes from the home page.
- View recipe details with ingredients and instructions.
- Profile section with a fake login/logout system.  
- To access the Profile page, you must first click the Login button.  
  Once logged in, you can view your profile details and log out when done.
- Styled with custom CSS for a clean and simple UI.

## Challenges
While working on this project, I faced a few challenges:  
- TheMealDB API has limited recipes and unfortunately doesn‚Äôt include Kenyan or African meals, which I really wanted to showcase.  
- I had to figure out how to later add custom Kenyan recipes on top of the API results.  
- Setting up navigation between Home, About, Profile, and Recipe pages was a bit tricky at first.  
- Since there‚Äôs no backend, I needed a simple way to manage login/logout, which I solved using React state.  

## Usage
1. Home Page ‚Äì Displays a list of recipes. You can search by ingredient or dish name.  
2. About Page ‚Äì Learn more about the app.  
3. Profile Page ‚Äì To view your profile, first click the Login button in the navigation bar.  
   - Once logged in, your profile details (name, email, favorite cuisine) will appear.  
   - You can click Logout at any time to return to the logged-out state.  
4. Recipe Details Page ‚Äì Click on a recipe card to view its ingredients and cooking instructions.  

## Next Steps
Moving forward, I‚Äôd like to:  
- Add more Kenyan and homemade recipes manually so the app reflects local cuisine.  
- Improve the search and filtering so it feels smoother and more useful.  
- Add a way to save favorite recipes for quick access.  
- Eventually build real authentication instead of just using React state.
